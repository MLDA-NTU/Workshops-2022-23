#Tensorflow Model Optimization Toolkit

Important: Baseline model needs to be trained before performing model optimization

A summary of the TFMOT workshop
1. Weight Pruning
2. Weight Clustering
3. Quantization
4. Collaborative Optimization

Steps to run the code
1. Preprocessing/Dataset generation
2. Training Baseline model
3. Run either weight pruning/weight clustering/quantization
4. (optional) collaborative optimization
